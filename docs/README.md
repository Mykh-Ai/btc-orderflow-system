# BTC Order Flow System (Demo)

This repository demonstrates the architecture and core components of a
Python-based real-time market data and trade execution system.

## Scope
This is a **demonstration / skeleton project**, focused on:
- real-time data ingestion and aggregation
- signal detection logic
- execution flow and risk control structure
- clean separation between data, signals, and execution

## Important
- This repository is **not a complete trading bot**
- No trading strategy or profitability claims are included
- Production-ready code, full execution logic, and integrations
  are maintained privately and shared only within client projects

## Components
- `aggregator` — real-time market data ingestion
- `deltascout` — order flow / imbalance signal detection
- `executor` — execution flow demo (orders, state, risk handling)
- `buyer` — example alert / action handling module

## Notes
This repository is intended as a **portfolio and technical showcase**
to demonstrate system design and engineering approach.

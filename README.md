# btc-orderflow-system

BTC order book analysis system based on **delta and imbalance signals**.

The project focuses on **market intelligence** — identifying valid entry points
from order flow dynamics, not on simple price-based indicators.

Automated trade execution is a **logical next step** in the project’s evolution
and is currently under development.

## Core Idea

> For traders, the real value is the **entry logic**.  
> Automation is only an execution convenience.

The system is designed with a clear separation between:
- market data preparation,
- signal generation,
- risk planning,
- execution,
- and human interaction.

This allows the same signals to be used in **manual, semi-automatic, or fully
automated** workflows.
